# Cosbin

- `Cosbin_functions.R` houses the cosbin library.
- Check `toy_exmaple.R` to see how cosbin works step by step.

- Full experiment workflow:
`generate_idealistic_simulation_data` (or any your data) 
-> calculate the average of each group as the input of cosbin
-> apply `cosbin()` function to the data
-> `evaluation.R` 
-> apply `cosbin_convert()` to get the final results

- Fast workflow:
`Example`
